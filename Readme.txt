So basically, all of the bootloader setup and whatnot is manually done.
The kernel, and all C code is made by the ai.
The ai can be told to put stuff in a header file but its kindof bad at actually doing that so I
     just cut and paste into header files from the kernel.C and did the #includes.
Oh and sorry for the mess of files in one directory, I couldent be bothered with doing it right.
one of the interesting things that happened was that the AI didnt have the index math right
    It didnt multiply the values by 2, so the text colors and backgrounds were jumbled and the clearscreen function made half of the screen green.
